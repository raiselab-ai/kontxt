# kontxt Documentation

Welcome to the kontxt documentation. This site is currently under active
development as we stabilise the v0.1 API. The goal is to provide a concise yet
practical reference for building production-grade LLM agents with explicit
control over their context windows.

## Contents

- [Getting Started](guides/getting-started.md) — install kontxt and build your
  first prompt.
- [API Reference](api/index.md) — detailed documentation for the core modules.
- [Design Principles](../README.md) — high-level philosophy and roadmap.

If you discover gaps or have suggestions, please open an issue or pull request.
